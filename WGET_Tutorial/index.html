                <h3>How do you use the programs and what are they for?</h3>
                <p>WGET is a simple command used on the terminal to collect 
                files from the internet, mainly integrated within GNU/Linux operating systems. It works by 
                making requests to the internet and pulls back requested items to be downloaded. This could be anything from a file,
                 picture, or spreadsheet.  
                 <p>cURL (Client URL) which comes preinstalled on MacOS and Windows 10 works similarly to WGET in that it also pulls data off the internet.However, cURL
                    is powered by the libcurl library to allow for upload/file transfers. cURL
                    provides a generic, language-agnostic way to demonstrate HTTP requests and
                    responses. Since each programming language has a different way of making
                    web calls. Rather than show how to make web calls in Java, Python, C++,
                    JavaScript, Ruby, and so on, you can just show the call using curl. Users can
                    see the format of the request, including any headers and other parameters.
                    Your users can translate this into the specific format for the language they’re
                    using. While curl was made to transfer just the URLs that the user specifies,
                    and does not contain any r WGET uses more common protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and FTPS. While CURL allows for
                  a much broader protocol coverage across the board. Another key difference is that due to the set focus of downloading for WGET, it comes with features to allow 
		  for a much easier download experience, such as resuming incomplete files, persistent connections, and NLS-based language support. </p>
                </p>
                <h3>When would you use one or the other to download a CSV file?</h3>
                <p>Both programs can be utilized in different ways depending on the use-case of the CSV file. For example if the CSV file was used to track a company’s shipping address locations, a single file could contain thousands upon thousands of entries. If this file was needed to be shared to a server URL, you would be using CURL to upload and download different iterations of the file. It would allow you to upload and store your backup and retrieve it from the console with a script for easier data entry. If the file was already uploaded to the cloud or there multiple CSV files needed to be downloaded, WGET would be able to accommodate better due to its resume and multidownload features.

                <h3>Using CURL</h3>
                <p>When you type an http address into a browser address bar, the server returns a
                    response, and your browser converts the response to a more visual display. But
                    you can also see the raw code by simply using the curl command in the
                    command line:</p>
                <code>curl https://example.com</code>
                <p>Curl will retrieve the HTML code for the site example.com. The browser’s job is to
                    make that code visually readable. curl shows you what you’re actually retrieving.</p>
                <p>When you type an address into a website, you see only the body of the
                    response. But actually, there’s more going on behind the scenes. When you
                    make the request, you’re sending a request header that contains information
                    about the request. The response also contains a response header.</p>    
                <p>For example, to see the response header in a curl request, include -i in the curl request:
                    curl <code>http://example.com -i</code></p>
                <p>SIDE NOTE:<p>
                    <p>REST APIs are basically request-and-response interactions between
                    clients and servers made through a common HTTP web protocol. HTTP web
                    protocols are language agnostic and therefore the same across different
                    platforms and systems. When documenting a REST API, it doesn’t matter
                    whether engineers build the API with Java, Ruby, Python, or some other
                    language. The requests are made over HTTP, and the responses are returned
                    through HTTP.
                    Restapi_restapi.svg
                    REST APIs can use any message format the API developers want to use,
                    including XML, JSON, Atom, RSS, CSV, HTML, while Most REST APIs use
                    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as the default message format. REST APIs
                    focus on resources and ways to access the resources.</p>
